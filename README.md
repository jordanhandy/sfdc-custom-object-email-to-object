# Email-to-Custom Object - Salesforce

Duplicate the capabilities of Email-to-Case by creating new records when an email arrives to a custom email service defined in Salesforce with a custom email handler and a Flow.

Can be used with any object with the flow image for inspiration.  Allow this custom object to publish to a feed, and you've mimicked the functionality of email-to-case.
